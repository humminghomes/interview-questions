## In-Person Practice Problem

### API Reference Exercise
1. Homes database, display all the homes, provide a detail for each home, edit & delete homes
2. Payment problem; architect a way for users to send an invoice for a job, edit the invoice, and correctly pay the correct person

### PR Review
1. Create a Pull Request in Swift UI, React, Django, and allow candidate to leave comments

## Phone Screens (in [Wiki](https://github.com/humminghomes/interview-questions/wiki))
__These questions are meant for the future to filter out candidates__
1. A few algorithm questions have been added to test junior engineers
2. A few technical questions are added to get an understanding how well a candidate understands the platform

## Process
1. Recruiter Screening (Nolan)
2. Internal HH Screening (work history, work with others, 1-2 technical questions)
3. Go over practice problem [1 hr] (with engineer)
4. Onsite:\
  a. Go over the PR review [30 mins] (with engineer)\
  b. 1 Leadership Interview [30 mins]\
  c. 1 Culture Interview [30 mins] (with non-engineer - Sales or Ops)
    - Look for empathy, communication, drive, interest in working in early stage
    
 * Maybe a lunch to replace culture
